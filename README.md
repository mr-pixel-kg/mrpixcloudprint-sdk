## Installation

## Usage
This project depends on Composer. It is recomended to let the Composer autoloader automatically load all your 
dependencies. The example below will show you how to include the client for the mpXcloudprint API.
```
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use Mrpix\CloudPrintSDK\HttpClient\CloudPrintClient;

$client = new CloudPrintClient();
```
### Authentification
Some actions require you to be authenticated. To do this, you have to call the login method before sending requests.
Here is a example on how to do that:
```
$client->login('your-username@example.com', 'yourSecretPassword');
```
